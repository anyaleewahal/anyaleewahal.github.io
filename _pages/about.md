Hi! I’m a Taiwanese-Indian-American water resources scholar. I’m interested in the intersection between water and policy — and, critically, harnessing research to inform policy and uplift marginalized communities.

I graduated from Georgetown in 2023 with a B.S. in Science, Technology, & International Affairs, concentrating in Energy and the Environment, and minoring in Mandarin Chinese. At Georgetown, I was fortunate to conduct research with Professors Mark Giordano and Rajesh Veeraraghavan. 

After I graduated, I became a Fulbright-Nehru Researcher based in Delhi, India. There, I conducted research identifying the gaps between water policy and practice in informal communities through fieldwork. Currently, I am a Marshall Scholar pursuing an MPhil in Water Science, Policy, and Management at Oxford, and am writing my dissertation on the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and water conservation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing fiction, creating art, and hiking in the great outdoors. You can reach me at anya.wahal@ouce.ox.ac.uk.
