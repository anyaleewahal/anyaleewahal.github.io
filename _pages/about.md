Hi! I'm a Taiwanese-Indian-American water resources scholar and storyteller. I'm interested in the intersection between water and policy â€” and, critically, harnessing research to inform policy and uplift marginalized communities.

I graduated from Georgetown in 2023 with a B.S. in Science, Technology, & International Affairs, concentrating in Energy and the Environment, and minoring in Chinese. At Georgetown, I was fortunate to conduct research with Professors Mark Giordano and Rajesh Veeraraghavan. 

Currently, I'm a Fulbright-Nehru Student Researcher based in Delhi. Here, I am learning Hindi and researching the disproportionate impacts of poor water quality on low-income women in Delhi. Next year, I'll be a Marshall Scholar pursuing an MPhil in Water Science, Policy, and Management at Oxford.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing fiction, creating art, and hiking in the great outdoors. You can reach me at alw288@georgetown.edu.
